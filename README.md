*Note*: EvalRS 2022 was held during CIKM 2022 (October 2022) as a data challenge and workshop. This README and the related links provide an overview of the competition and archive the artifacts from the event to benefit the RecSys community. If you are interested in running the evaluation loop _exactly as it was during EvalRS 2022_, the original README, with rules, instructions and full guidelines can be found untouched [here](/README_CIKM_2022.md).

*Important*: while this README is an archive for the event and the workshop, _all the code, data, tests and evaluation methodology_ are still fully available in this very [repository](/README_CIKM_2022.md). If you are working on the evaluation of RecSys, or you wish to run your latest model on Last.FM through a set of diverse tests, you can (and should!) re-use this repository and our leaderboard (as a ready-to-go baseline).

## Overview

This is the official repository for [EvalRS @ CIKM 2022](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/): _a Rounded Evaluation of Recommender Systems_. The aim of the challenge was to evaluate recommender systems across a set of important dimensions (accuracy being _one_ of them) through a principled and re-usable sets of abstractions, as provided by [RecList](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist) ðŸš€. EvalRS is based on the [LFM-1b Dataset, Corpus of Music Listening Events for Music Recommendation](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/): participants were asked to solve a typical user-item scenario and recommend new songs to users.

During CIKM 2022, we organized a popular workshop on rounded evaluation for RecSys, including our [reflections](/workshop_slides/challenge_presentation_tagliabue.pdf) as organizers of the event, the best paper [presentation](/workshop_slides/EvalRS_teamML.pdf) and keynotes from two renown practitioners, Prof. [Jannach](/workshop_slides/keynote_jannach.pdf) and Prof. [Ekstrand](/workshop_slides/keynote_ekstrand.pdf).

If you are interested in running the same evaluation loop on your own model, re-use our baselines, or simply revisit the rules and guidelines of the original event, please check the official [competition README](/README_CIKM_2022.md). The original README includes also in-depth dataset analyses and explanations on how to run a model and add a custom test to [RecList](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist). For an introduction to the main themes of this competition and details on our methodology, please refer to the workshop [presentation](/workshop_slides/challenge_presentation_tagliabue.pdf) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05772).

_Papers, code, presentations from EvalRS are all freely available for the community through this repository: check the appropriate sections below for the Award recipients and the materials provided by organizers and partecipants._
